## Project Description

This project aims to automate mouse movements and clicks using the `pyautogui` library in Python. This library allows you to easily perform tasks like moving the mouse to a specific position on the screen and clicking.

To get started, you will need to install the `pyautogui` library and ensure that you have Python installed on your system. Below are the steps you need to follow to install the library and run the Python script.

### Installation Steps

1. **Install Python**:
   - If you don't have Python installed, download the installer for Python 3.x from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   - Follow the installation instructions for your operating system. Make sure to check the option to add Python to your system's PATH during the installation.

2. **Verify Python Installation**:
   - Open your terminal (Command Prompt on Windows, Terminal on macOS or Linux) and run the following command to check if Python is installed:

     ```bash
     python --version
     ```

   - You should see the version of Python you have installed.

3. **Install pip**:
   - `pip` is a package manager for Python and is included with Python 3.4 and later. To check if `pip` is installed, run:

     ```bash
     pip --version
     ```

   - If `pip` is not installed, you can follow the instructions on the [pip installation page](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

4. **Install the PyAutoGUI Library**:
   - With Python and `pip` installed, you can now install the `pyautogui` library. In your terminal, run the following command:

     ```bash
     pip install pyautogui
     ```

5. **Install Additional Dependencies**:
   - Some platforms may require additional dependencies for `pyautogui`. Run the following command to install them:

     ```bash
     pip install pygetwindow pymsgbox pyscreeze Pillow
     ```

   - Alternatively, you can install all required libraries in one command:

     ```bash
     pip install pyautogui Pillow pygetwindow pymsgbox pyscreeze
     ```

6. **Run Your Python Script**:
   - Now you are ready to use `pyautogui`. Create a Python script file (e.g., `mouse_automation.py`) and add your code to automate mouse movements and clicks.
   - Run your script using the following command:

     ```bash
     python mouse_click.py
     ```

Following these steps will set up your environment to use the `pyautogui` library and allow you to automate mouse actions in Python.
